# Pagination
Allows pagination between different pages represented in JSON.
Pages are represented in a format where each page has an ID, an associated image and description, and linked pages.

Pagination begins with the first ID, where the first page is rendered.
Associated pages are linked such that clicking replaces the current page and renders the new page.
